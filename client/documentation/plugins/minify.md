### Minify ###

Minify is used to smoosh your CSS and javascript. It uses [clean-css](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css) for minifying CSS and [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) for minifying javascript.

> **Note:** For expected results, you should run minify after you run the `bundle` plugin, and before you run the `package` plugin.

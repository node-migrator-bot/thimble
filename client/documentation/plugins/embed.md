### Embed ###

Embed compiles your client-side templates into functions. When the embed plugin runs, it looks for `script` tags that have `type = "text/template"`, compiles them, and attaches them to the `namespace`.`template` object, where both `namespace` and `template` are configurable. Therefore when you run your application, your templates are ready to be called.

For example:

    <script src = "contact.mu" type = "text/template"></script>
    
Will compile to:

    <script type = "text/javascript">
      window.JST['contact'] = 
        function(locals) { ... };
    </script>
    
That can be called by: 
    
    window.JST['contact']({
      name : "Matt Mueller",
      age  : 22
    });

> Note: By default, your templates are attached to the `window.JST` object.

Embed can also embed JSON files, so if I have the following file, `contact.json`:

    {
      "name" : "Matt Mueller",
      "age"  : 22
    }

I can embed it using:

    <script src="contact.json"></script>
    
That can be called by:
  
    window.JST['contact']['name']
    
If you'd like to change json files to use a key different than `options.template`, you can specify that in the embed options:

    thimble.embed({
      json : "testdata"
    });

This will allow the json object to be called by:
  
    window.testdata['contact']['name']

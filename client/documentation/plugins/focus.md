### Focus ###

<!-- Focus provides a glimpse at the power of thimble. This plugin allows you can specify a selector to focus on. Say for example we have a chat window we want to focus on. We could write:
  
    thim.use(thimble.focus('#chat'));

This will add transparency to all of the `#chat` element's siblings, allowing you to focus on what's important at the moment. -->

*Coming Soon!* This plugin allows you to specify certain selectors to focus on, dimming distracting elements so you can focus on parts of the UI that matter to you.

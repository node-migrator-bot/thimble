## Introduction ##

Thimble is middleware for [express](http://expressjs.com) that simplifies modern web development. 

Our field moves fast. Every day there is some new language to learn or technique to apply. It seems like we're always adding tools to our workflow to take advantage of these new features. Generally, these tools help us build better products faster. 

However, each time we add a new tool, we add just a little bit more complexity to our application. Maybe just one more step. Eventually these steps add up and if we're not careful the tools we put in place to move faster end up slowing us down. This is when web development becomes no fun.

Thimble is an attempt to break free from our self-destructive habits and take advantage of all these fantastic innovations while keeping the same development speed that we love. By adding an HTML parser to the development cycle, we can manipulate our response on the fly, allowing us to dynamically embed templates, compile languages, minify assets, and much more.

Thimble is hosted on [Github](http://github.com/MatthewMueller/thimble). You can report bugs and discuss features on the [issues page](http://github.com/MatthewMueller/thimble/issues), or send tweets to [@mattmueller](https://twitter.com/mattmueller).

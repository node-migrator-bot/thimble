## Introduction ##

Thimble is an extendable frontend tool that transforms your HTML to automate tedious tasks during web development. Thimble also introduces new features to help you develop more modular web applications. 

___Thimble supercharges developer productivity without sacrificing runtime efficiency___.

During development, thimble inserts two middleware layers. The first layer manipulates your page request, running plugins like flatten and embed. The second layer catches requested assets, offering seamless integration with the latest interpreters and preprocessors like coffeescript and stylus. 

For production, thimble provides a build tool that compiles and bundles your assets into a single package that you can dish out to your servers.

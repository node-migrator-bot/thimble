Thimble has been quite the project. I first started thinking about thimble a year ago and it took three complete re-writes to get it to where it is today. This project also spawned the development of [cheerio](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio), the HTML library that powers thimble because I wanted a faster and more intuitive alternative to [JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).

Many thanks to the contributors and users of cheerio for battle-testing the library. I'd also like to thank [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia) - many of the libraries for this project are his and much of what I learned about clean asynchronous programming is a result of studying his coding style.
